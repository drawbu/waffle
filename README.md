The aim of the project is to learn C and X11, and have fun, and maybe one day 
making a viable product (*maybe*).

Press <kbd>META</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open kitty (the default terminal) on
top of the other apps.

- Move windows around using <kbd>META</kbd> + <kbd>Left click</kbd> when 
  hovering a window. The window will go on top of the others.
- Resize windows using <kbd>META</kbd> + <kbd>Right click</kbd>. The window will 
  resize based on the corner you clicked.
